### v1.4.0

**The Raven Update**
- This is a very big update with lots of added Heretic + Hexen features
- This update also includes lots of new features
- Many of the software (and OpenGL) drawing functions were reworked significantly

**Heretic + Hexen**
- Added support for Hexen's scrolling double skies
  - Implemented for both Software and OpenGL
- Added proper support for Hexen's FOG
  - Software and OpenGL
- Added parallax moving automap background
- Added support for Tintable Translucency
  - Heretic and Hexen monsters now use the correct translucency
  - This includes Hexen's ALTSHADOW translucency
- Added the dark shading on the sides of the Heretic Health chain
- Fixed Heretic's E3 "Demon Scroll" to now support widescreen patch format scrolling
  - Note this does look a little jank compared to the Vanilla RAW screens
- Fix weird text spacing on full `big_***` widgets for Heretic + Hexen
- "Smooth Health / Armor %" now adds animated armor count scrolling to Heretic
- Added exhud support for Hexen's "red numbers" when on low health
- Disable Heretic's "Chain Wiggle" when player is dead
- Fixed a Heretic shareware crash regarding the `big_armor` widget
- Heretic now uses the correct "GRNROCK" background both for retail and shareware
- Implemented Raven-style `IDDQD` and `IDKFA` joke cheats
- During casual play to accommodate the `IDKFA` cheat for Heretic, the wand is now checked if the player owns it or not
- Reworked default automap colours for both Heretic + Hexen
- Fixed a crash that happened with `HEXDD.WAD` MAP39

**Automap Improvements**
- Added a "Line Width" option similar to the KEX port
  - Default is "auto", which you can directly set a specific width
- Automap now has background and Parallax support for Heretic / Hexen
  - Also works for Doom, although at the moment the flat isn't exactly customisable
  - Includes a darkening option as well as a parallax toggle in case you just want the background
- Fixed Minimap Coordinates not updating when chaging resolution
  - Also fixes a potential crash that could happen because of this

**Translucency Improvements**
- Heretic + Hexen now use Tinttable for their translucency (they are now correct)
- Added "extra shadows" and "menu translucency" options to the menu
- Added the ability to adjust the translucency of the exhud elements (useful for OLED)
- Added support for Hexen's second ALTSHADOW translucency (you can see this when spawning a Maulotaur)

**Rendering Improvements**
- Patch drawing has been completely reworked
  - Patches can now be drawn translucent (and colour translated)
  - Patches now can be cropped from their original size (this is more a backend change, but can allow for many changes down the road)
  - Patches can now have a drop shadow (Heretic + Hexen has a text shadow function that is now implemented)
- Completely reworked rendering pipelines
  - Previously only supported Translucent OR color translated
  - Now can support both, as well as ALTSHADOW, and shadowed patches
- Exhud now has it's own translucency (can be useful for OLED screens)

**Exhud Improvements**
- Health and armor counts now follow the "Smooth Health / Armor %" option (they are animated)
- Added new `big_artifact_bar` widget which matches Vanilla Heretic / Hexen fullscreen inventory bar
  - Translucent like in Vanilla
  - Works in conjunction with `big_artifact` (when `big_artifact_bar` is showing, `big_artifact` hides)
- `announce_message` when "Announce Map" is set to "on", now shows the author name in a different colour under the map title
  - author uses new `NYANTC` color `hud_announce_author`

**ENDOOM Improvements**
- ENDOOM has been completely reworked to match closer to Woof
- ENDOOM can now be shown fullscreen
- ENDOOM is now drawn inside the existing window, instead of creating a new window
- Reworked ENDOOM for OpenGL so that it can be drawn inside the same window

**More Improvements**
- New Software "Fuzz Scale At Distance" option that allows you to scale the fuzz of specteres from a distance
  - So that the pixels behind far away Spectere don't look super ugly
- During casual play, you can now advance the text screen (via key press) for Doom 1 and Heretic
- The "GRNROCK" screen border is now properly scaled up
- Removed `IDK` cheat in favor of `TNTKA` (this caused issues with new Heretic / Hexen cheats)
- Added new Nyan cheats `STRIP` and `KILLME`

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed Minimap Coordinates not updating when chaging resolution
  - Also fixes a potential crash that could happen because of this
- A colour is now drawn behind patches like TITLEPIC, INTERMISSION, etc
  - Fixes HOMing Eternal Doom CREDIT
- Fixed "pistol start" not updating from the "Compatibility" menu
- Fixed a DEHACKED cheats oversight (Thanks Gibus Wearing Brony)
