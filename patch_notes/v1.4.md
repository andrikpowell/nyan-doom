- Allows over/under for just the player or for all things.
- Added a Heretic adjacent option that strives to fix stuck flying enemies (experimental)
- The feature is disable for demo recording/playback as well as for MAPINFO wads.

**Heretic + Hexen Additions**
- Added `SWITCHES` support for Heretic (tested "Quoth the Raven")

- Add Dynamic credits to Heretic / Hexen demoloop

**Cheats**

- Software drawing has been redone for better performance

- When `map_use_multisampling` is enabled, it now will just use the normal thick drawing method (there was no performance benefit + quality was negligible)
- Software and OpenGL line thickness are slightly more gradual now
- Minimap changed to always use 1x line thickness (bigger lines look bad imo)

**Reduced Palette Options**
- Changed "Pain Palette Range" option to adding support for all palettes.
- Now for "Pain", "Pickup", "Powers", and "Effects" (NEW), there are full/reduced/off settings
- Added "Palette Effects" to adjust Hexen exclusive palettes (example: poison, 4th weapon palettes)

**Added Message Wordwrap / Ellipsis**
- The automap level name is now shortened by an Ellipsis when it goes off screen
