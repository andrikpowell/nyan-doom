### v1.4.2

**FluidSynth Bug Fix Update**
- Update FluidSynth - Fixes some wads (example: Neptunian Nightmare) from hard crashing (thanks rfomin for helping me debug this)

### v1.4.1

**New Features**
- Added "Freelook Enahanced Flight" option (disabled for demos)
  - This allows you to fly up/down in the direction of your mouse (like the KEX port)
- Added Freelook Auto-Aim feature (disabled for demos)
  - Additional option for OpenGL for auto-aim to be based on how close the enemy is to the crosshair.
- Add "Pain Palette Range" option (disabled for demos)
  - Allows you to shorten the range of the pain palette (default 8), so that the screen doesn't get too red
- "Skip IWAD Story Text" now supports UMAPINFO wads
- "Rewind Message" option now shows specific frame (loosely based on Nugget Doom)
- Added "Detailed Quicksave" option (to avoid a super long quicksave message)
- Added "Pickup Multiple Areamaps" to menu (disabled for demos)

**Cheat Tweaks**
- Cheats are now separated by game (Doom vs Heretic vs Hexen)
  - Boom cheats like `TNTEM` and such still work for any game, but for main cheats, you'll need to use the game specific cheats
  - Console can be used to circumvent this
- Better tracking for when cheats are being typed in
- Disable "Death Use" when typing in cheats (aka GOD when trying to resurrect)
- Added Hexen `MARTEK`, `CONAN`, and `QUICKEN` cheats
- Added "Heretic + Hexen" KEX cheat alias (examples `healthyself`, `gunsgunsguns`, `ghost`, etc)
- Added more detailed messages for `IDDWT` cheat

**ENDOOM Improvements**
- OpenGL ENDOOM has been vastly improved and now mirrors the quality of software
- ENDOOM has now been updated with Zokum's new font
- "PWAD Only" option has been replaced with "Smart" which acts the same way but for when you are just playing the IWAD, it'll show the ENDOOM.

**Demo and Limit-Removing Stuff**
- "Death Use - Nothing" can now be used when recording / playing back demos
- "Limit-Removing" status is now added to the demo footer
- "Limit Removing" now loads when a demo is recorded with it active.
- Fixed a crash that could happen with a map that had a MissedBackside Overflow running under "Limit-Removing"
- Overflows will now show in the console when being emulated (but with warnings off). The "Warn" options now only apply to popup messages.

**Menu Improvements**
- Added support for submenus (menus have been reorganised and are now easier to navigate)
- Added advanced "Colored Blood" option (you can now choose the color of the blood for Hell Knights, Barons, Cacodemons, and Spectres)
- Added new "Highlight Nyan Features" option which will highlight exclusive Nyan Doom features over its parent port DSDA-Doom

**Heretic + Hexen**
- When player is gibbed, and is resurrected, the view will no longer be slanted upwards
- Added Random Class Selection for Hexen
- Added support for Hexen's "Yellow Messages"
- Added "Etereal Travel" graphic when traveling to other maps
- Add "Skip Etereal Travel" option for faster map transitions (default for the KEX port)

**Automap Improvements**
- Software and OpenGL are now consistent with automap line thickness
- Line thickness now affects points as well (example being the middle crosshair)

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed "Always Pistol Start" getting reverted upon loading a saved game
- Detached Weapon sprite fuzz from distance sprite fuzz (fixes to the new "Fuzz Scale At Distance" option)
- Fixed Doom 2 "wait for a key press to continue" logic (thanks cu2
 for the bug report)
- "Report Revealed Secrets" option is now set to "on" by default (thanks Nacho_y for the report)
- Revert HEXDD.WAD MAP39 fix (it seems it's not needed anymore?)
- Fixed a few missing "Extra Shadows"
- Fixed `COMPLVL` / `GAMEVERS` being skipped after internal demos started playing

### v1.4.0

  - Implemented for both Software and OpenGL
- Added proper support for Hexen's FOG

  - This includes Hexen's ALTSHADOW translucency

- Reworked default automap colours for both Heretic + Hexen

**Automap Improvements**
- Added a "Line Width" option similar to the KEX port
  - Default is "auto", which you can directly set a specific width
- Automap now has background and Parallax support for Heretic / Hexen
  - Also works for Doom, although at the moment the flat isn't exactly customisable
  - Includes a darkening option as well as a parallax toggle in case you just want the background
- Fixed Minimap Coordinates not updating when chaging resolution
  - Also fixes a potential crash that could happen because of this

**Translucency Improvements**
- Heretic + Hexen now use Tinttable for their translucency (they are now correct)
- Added "extra shadows" and "menu translucency" options to the menu

**Rendering Improvements**
- Patch drawing has been completely reworked
  - Patches can now be drawn translucent (and colour translated)
  - Patches now can be cropped from their original size (this is more a backend change, but can allow for many changes down the road)
  - Patches can now have a drop shadow (Heretic + Hexen has a text shadow function that is now implemented)
- Completely reworked rendering pipelines
  - Previously only supported Translucent OR color translated
  - Now can support both, as well as ALTSHADOW, and shadowed patches
- Exhud now has it's own translucency (can be useful for OLED screens)

**Exhud Improvements**
- Health and armor counts now follow the "Smooth Health / Armor %" option (they are animated)
- Added new `big_artifact_bar` widget which matches Vanilla Heretic / Hexen fullscreen inventory bar
  - Translucent like in Vanilla
  - Works in conjunction with `big_artifact` (when `big_artifact_bar` is showing, `big_artifact` hides)

  - author uses new `NYANTC` color `hud_announce_author`

**ENDOOM Improvements**
- ENDOOM has been completely reworked to match closer to Woof
- ENDOOM can now be shown fullscreen
- ENDOOM is now drawn inside the existing window, instead of creating a new window
- Reworked ENDOOM for OpenGL so that it can be drawn inside the same window

**More Improvements**
- New Software "Fuzz Scale At Distance" option that allows you to scale the fuzz of specteres from a distance
  - So that the pixels behind far away Spectere don't look super ugly
- During casual play, you can now advance the text screen (via key press) for Doom 1 and Heretic
- The "GRNROCK" screen border is now properly scaled up
- Removed `IDK` cheat in favor of `TNTKA` (this caused issues with new Heretic / Hexen cheats)
