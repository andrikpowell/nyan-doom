### v1.2.3

**Better IWAD Detection**
- Added "GAMEINFO" lump support for autodetecting IWADs
- If any Doom 1 maps are found in the PWAD (E#M#), DOOM.WAD will be loaded instead of DOOM2.WAD
- This is a bigger deal than it seems, as Doom originally would only load the IWAD before the PWAD files. As a result, most ports aren't able to read PWAD lumps to get an IWAD, the main exceptions being ZDoom-based ports and KEX.

**Custom Skills Support**
 - Added the ability to clear and define custom skills via the [`SKILLDEF`](../docs/skilldef.md) lump
   - SKILLDEF is intended for non-UDMF maps, unlike the skill definition in MAPINFO.
   - Skill definitions in the format of MAPINFO
   - Disabled if `MAPINFO` features are detected
 **"UV Plus" 6th Skill Support**
 - A simple UV Plus difficulty can be added instead by using a "M_UVPLUS" graphic lump, which when detected will add a new sixth UV Plus skill (UV placement + SpawnMulti)
   - This functionality is disabled upon detecting `SKILLDEF`
   - Disabled if `MAPINFO` features are detected

**More TC game support**
- Added support for Freedoom (Phase 1, Phase 2, FreeDM), Chex 3 Vanilla / Modding Edition
- TC autoload folders for Freedoom and Chex
- TC games no longer use "doom-all" autoload folder
- Removed autoload folders for REKKR (future TC games will not have an autoload folder by default)
- Disabled Dynamic Boom Help / Credit screens for TC games

**New Cheats / Tweaks**
- New Cheats
  - SKILL - change the skill level in-game (requires level restart) (Woof)
  - IDMUSRR - change music to a random track
  - IDMUS00 - reset music to map default
  - CAMERA - useful for taking screenshots / videos
    - Enables Godmode, NoTarget, and Flying
    - Disables viewbob, flying bob, and item pickup
    - Hides player weapon
  - IDNUT
- Cheat Optimisations / Tweaks
  - TNTCOMP, SKILL, IDCLEV, now show the current status via message (Woof)
  - SKILL now prints skill number, as well as skill name (if not TC Game)
  - IDMUS cheat now tells you what map music it is playing
  - TNTCOMP is now disabled in Heretic / Hexen / Doom v1.1
  - Fixed IDMUS for Doom 1

**Doom 1 Intermission Fixes**
- Fix UMAPINFO text screens getting skipped in Doom 1 (Woof)
- Fix Doom 1 Intermission animations from flickering / Resetting (Crispy Doom)
- Show E2M9 on Intermission screens if it has been completed (Crispy Doom)
- Show E2M7 screen on intermission for E2M8 (Instead of E2M5?)

**Doom v1.0/v1.1 Support (For Historical Purposes)**
- Nyan Doom can now play the 1.0/1.1 version of DOOM.WAD
- Autoloads v1.2 compatability (disabling TNTCOMP)
- Demo recording / playback is not supported for v1.1
- Certain curiousities with 1.0/1.1 support:
  - Added support for two lump statusbar
  - Certain sfx are replaced that aren't present (DSGETPOW, DSITMBK, DSPDIEHI, etc)
  - Rad suits count towards the item count
  - Nightmare skill disabled

**Weapon Alignment / Interpolation Fixes**
  - Fix Vanilla Weapon Switch Logic (example: dehacked chainsaw ammo weapon in [RUST /// THE INFERNAL MACHINE](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/144559))
  - Fix jerky weaponbob for animated weapons (aka Chainsaw)
  - Fix weapon showing at the start of the level (Woof)
  - Fix weapon jitter when resizing the screensize
  - Fix Weapon Alignment for Custom Dehacked States (no longer skips A_Raise or A_Lower animation)
  - Fix Melee Hexen Weapons Misalignment when Weapon Alignment is active
  
**"Blinking Keys" Tweaks / Fixes**
- Now obeys "Single Key Display"
- Don't "Blink Keys" if condition is impossible (such as a 6 key door with not all the keys in the map like in Judgment)
- Spawned keys are now taken into account

**Changed Settings**
- Added "Level Stat Totals" option for easy access to enable/disable showing stat totals on the exhud and automap stats
- Removed "Classic Zoom Levels" option (now always enabled)

- Fixed Dehacked Cheat Entry when recording demos (previously only did vanilla cheat codes)

- Animate lump code has been greatly simplified and improved
- Completely removed statusbar refresh logic (unnecessary with little performance impact)
- Fix Statusbar Face being wrong for a few tics when entering another level (Crispy Doom)
- Allow ghost translucency in all complevels (cuz apparently boom ghosts exist??)
- Add SSG frame fix (Woof)

- [Limit-Removing](../docs/limit_removing.md) Tweaks

  - Minor fixes with the console printing "limit-removing" status

- Added option to allow the "tag finder" to be enabled if a computer area map has been found *(inspired by PrBoom X)*
- Added "Auto Switch Weapon on Pickup" Option (Casual Only)
- Now supports `NYANHUD` for exhud. (`DSDAHUD` can still be read if found, but `NYANHUD` has been added since Nyan Doom supports more widgets that DSDA Doom does not)

- Automap now only uses automap extended hud

**Other stuff**
- Menu messages can now be dismissed via BACKSPACE
