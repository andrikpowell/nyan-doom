### v1.2.5

**Nyan-Specific Fixes**
- Fix widescreen stbar for raven games
- Tweak Doom 1 IWAD loading to allow for all episode IWADs
- Remove scrollbar on HELP screen

**DSDA-Doom Update Included:**
- [DSDA-Doom v0.29.0 features](/patch_notes/v0.29.md)

### v1.2.4

**Hotfix Changes**
- This is a hotfix that fixes zip files when using the "-iwad" argument and when in autoload.

### v1.2.3

**Better IWAD Detection**
- Added "GAMEINFO" lump support for autodetecting IWADs
- If any Doom 1 maps are found in the PWAD (E#M#), DOOM.WAD will be loaded instead of DOOM2.WAD
- This is a bigger deal than it seems, as Doom originally would only load the IWAD before the PWAD files. As a result, most ports aren't able to read PWAD lumps to get an IWAD, the main exceptions being ZDoom-based ports and KEX.

**"UV Plus" 6th Skill Support**
- A simple UV Plus difficulty can be added by including a `NYANSKLG` (graphic) lump, which when detected will add a new sixth UV Plus skill (UV placement + SpawnMulti)
  - Disabled if `MAPINFO` features are detected
  - Disabled when trying to record demos (use `-skill 4 -coop_spawns` instead)
  - A custom confirm message can be added via a `NYANSKLM` (message) lump *(not MAPINFO formatted, just simple text without quotes or `\n`)*

**Random Music Option**
- In "Nyan Options", there is a new option called "Play Random Music"
  - Will randomly choose a track from the map lumps that exist
  - Last 5 tracks will not be played if have been played already
  - Does not account for maps using the same music track
    - Example 1: could play MAP15 music for MAP01 for Doom II
    - Example 2: in UMAPINFO, if MAP03 and MAP07 use the same MIDI lump, they are considered separate tracks
  - Savegames will retain the current "random" track (as well as the last 5 tracks played)
  - Title, Intermission, and story music are excluded from randomisation
- Random music functionality is tied with IDMUSRR and "Random Music" hotkey (meaning they use the last 5 tracks played system)

**New Cheats / Tweaks**
- New Cheats
  - SKILL - change the skill level in-game (requires level restart) (Woof)
  - IDMUSRR - change music to a random track
  - IDMUS00 - reset music to map default
  - CAMERA - useful for taking screenshots / videos
    - Enables Godmode, NoTarget, and Flying
    - Disables viewbob, flying bob, and item pickup
    - Hides player weapon
  - IDNUT
- Cheat Optimisations / Tweaks
  - TNTCOMP, SKILL, IDCLEV, now show the current status via message (Woof)
  - SKILL now prints skill number, as well as skill name (if not TC Game)
  - IDMUS cheat now tells you what map music it is playing
  - TNTCOMP is now disabled in Heretic / Hexen / Doom v1.1
  - Fixed IDMUS for Doom 1

**More TC game support**
- Added support for Freedoom (Phase 1, Phase 2, FreeDM), Chex 3 Vanilla / Modding Edition
- TC autoload folders for Freedoom and Chex
- TC games no longer use "doom-all" autoload folder
- Removed autoload folders for REKKR (future TC games will not have an autoload folder by default)
- Disabled Dynamic Boom Help / Credit screens for TC games

**Doom 1 Intermission Fixes**
- Fix UMAPINFO text screens getting skipped in Doom 1 (Woof)
- Fix Doom 1 Intermission animations from flickering / Resetting (Crispy Doom)
- Show E2M9 on Intermission screens if it has been completed (Crispy Doom)
- Show E2M7 screen on intermission for E2M8 (Instead of E2M5?)

**Doom v1.0/v1.1 Support (For Historical Purposes)**
- Nyan Doom can now play the 1.0/1.1 version of DOOM.WAD
- Autoloads v1.2 compatability (disabling TNTCOMP)
- Demo recording / playback is not supported for v1.1
- Certain curiousities with 1.0/1.1 support:
  - Added support for two lump statusbar
  - Certain sfx are replaced that aren't present (DSGETPOW, DSITMBK, DSPDIEHI, etc)
  - Rad suits count towards the item count
  - Nightmare skill disabled

**Weapon Alignment / Interpolation Fixes**
  - Fix Vanilla Weapon Switch Logic (example: dehacked chainsaw ammo weapon in [RUST /// THE INFERNAL MACHINE](https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/144559))
  - Fix jerky weaponbob for animated weapons (aka Chainsaw)
  - Fix weapon showing at the start of the level (Woof)
  - Fix weapon jitter when resizing the screensize
  - Fix Weapon Alignment for Custom Dehacked States (no longer skips A_Raise or A_Lower animation)
  - Fix Melee Hexen Weapons Misalignment when Weapon Alignment is active
  
**"Blinking Keys" Tweaks / Fixes**
- Now obeys "Single Key Display"
- Don't "Blink Keys" if condition is impossible (such as a 6 key door with not all the keys in the map like in Judgment)
- Spawned keys are now taken into account

**Changed Settings**
- Added "Level Stat Totals" option for easy access to enable/disable showing stat totals on the exhud and automap stats
- Removed "Classic Zoom Levels" option (now always enabled)
- Removed "Area Map Allows Tag Highlight" feature
- Removed "Pause After Intermission" option (on by default when not demo-recording)
- Separated "Player Trail Mode" into two options

**Other Stuff**
- GAMEVERS `limit` has been changed to `nolimits` *(although `limit` will still work)*
- Changed default `status_widget` coordinates for `NYANHUD`.
- You can now pick up multiple computer area maps (not in demos or strict mode) (you can change this via `dsda_multiple_area_maps` config-only option)
- Automap `map_totals` widget has been redesigned to replace "Monsters / Secrets / Items" to a more simple "K / I / S" (thanks for the idea s4f3s3x)
- "Clear Marks" is now "Clear Last Mark" and only clears the last mark placed (Woof)
- Fixed Dehacked Cheat Entry when recording demos (previously only did vanilla cheat codes)
- Removed old method for applying Dehacked Cheats (which would only apply cheats at start-up). Now it is an option in the menu ("Use Dehacked Cheats").
- Even more improvements to the "Enhanced Lite Amp" option
- Animate lump code has been greatly simplified and improved
- Completely removed statusbar refresh logic (unnecessary with little performance impact)
- Fix Statusbar Face being wrong for a few tics when entering another level (Crispy Doom)

- Add SSG frame fix (Woof)

**Fixes from DSDA-Doom (for stability/compatibility reasons)**
- Add missing <math.h> include (suve)
- Added complevel check for episode 4 (Spectere)
- Update vcpkg (rfomin)
- Using PROJECT_* instead of PACKAGE_* variables in CMake (rfomin)

### v1.2.2

- Due to the switch texture fix, the savegame information has been changed (aka old savegames will be incompatible)

**New Features**
- Added "Software Fuzz Mode" Options (Vanilla, Refraction, Shadow) [Strict Mode]

**Nyan Lump Changes:**

- [Limit-Removing](../docs/limit_removing.md) Tweaks

  - Minor fixes with the console printing "limit-removing" status

- Added option to allow the "tag finder" to be enabled if a computer area map has been found *(inspired by PrBoom X)*
- Added "Auto Switch Weapon on Pickup" Option (Casual Only)
- Now supports `NYANHUD` for exhud. (`DSDAHUD` can still be read if found, but `NYANHUD` has been added since Nyan Doom supports more widgets that DSDA Doom does not)

- Allows users to customise the default Boom translucency for things.
- Added "Translucency for Ghosts" Vanilla option
- Added "Vanilla Translucency" emulation option for adding translucency to things under Vanilla complevels

**New Features coming to DSDA Doom (from Nyan Doom)**

- Automap now only uses automap extended hud

**Other stuff**
- Menu messages can now be dismissed via BACKSPACE
- Removed "Statusbar and Menu Appearance" option from menu (still accessible via config). This is an awful option that should only be set to "Doom Format".
