### v1.3.0

**The Colorful Update**
- Added `Solid Color Background` statusbar feature (inspired by Woof - different implementation)
- Added `Colored Borderbox` feature
  - Colors the borders of sides of graphics (ex: TITLEPIC, INTERPIC, HELP, etc) based on the average color of said lump
  - Loosely based off Doom Retro implimentation
  - Also works for Raw-format Heretic / Hexen graphics

**Graphic Tweaks**
- OpenGL dark overlay is now improved
  - now only uses the main palette, and ignores other colormaps (example: invulnerabilty, Boom Colormap sectors)
- Extended `Skip IWAD Map Names` logic to Intermission (if no `CWILV**` graphics found, use generic `Level #` text similar to UMAPINFO)
- Reworked Help / ReadMe screens
  - Now shows PWAD CREDIT if PWAD HELP isn't found (since PrBoom+ had the CREDIT for HELP for many years)
  - Order of precedence: PWAD HELP > PWAD CREDIT > Nyan Doom Credit Screen

**Menu / Config Stuff**
- Complete menu layout overhaul (now much closer to DSDA-Doom)
- Added dependant menu options (some options get disabled under certain conditions)
- Complevel menu option is disabled if `-complevel ##` or `COMPLVL`/`GAMEVERS` lump is read (since changing this setting did nothing already in this context)
- Combined boom and vanilla translucency settings into one setting (`Display > Nyan > Translucent Sprites`)
- Removed `SSG on Arms` option in menu (config option still available)
- Set `Skip IWAD Map Names` to "on" by default

**Cheats**
- Added `IDDWT #` cheat to find placed weapons on the automap
  - Uses weapon number to find weapon (ex: `IDDWT 3` will look for the shotgun)
  - Chainsaw (8) and SSG (9) use Boom weapon numbers
  - Cheat is repeatable (once typing `IDDWT 3`, you can continue hitting `3` to cycle through all map placed shotguns in the map)
  - Also supports Heretic and Hexen

**Automap**
- Automap is now printed at full screen regardless of lower zoom levels (via -/+).
  - Opaque automap will now print full screen (just like in Vanilla and Woof)
  - Overlay automaps will now print automap/fade over `GRNROCK` border (similar to Woof)
- Automap Title will now cycle between the map title and author if UMAPINFO/MAPINFO author field is present (can be disabled via `map_title` argument or menu option: `Automap > Cycle Level Title / Author`)

**Nyan Indicator Tweaks**
- Berserk graphic indicator is now simplified (now just `STFPSTR0-1`) [Removed Unity graphic in favour of lump colour translation]
- Armor / Berserk Indicators now only use the default lumps if found in a PWAD
  - Berserk off/on:       `STFPSTR0`/`STFPSTR1`
  - Armor off/green/blue: `STFARMS0`/`STFARMS1`/`STFARMS2`

**Bug Fixes**
- Fixed multiplayer demo playback crash (example: Alien Vendetta's first Multiplayer Internal Demo)
- Fixed Doom Shareware crash (exhud was looking for the berserk sprite)
- Fixed Heretic Shareware crash (when using warp above episode 1)
- Fixed Hexen 4th weapon pieces on HUD
- Disabled screenwipe for Heretic
- Fixed TNTFAST cheat

**Other stuff**
- Added "Rewind" off/on switch
- Added "Skip Artifact" key for Raven games
- `Randomize Music` feature is now applied temporarily via saved games
- Advanced Translucent Options are now disabled under Strict Mode
- `Gray %` no longer requires `Colored Numbers` to be enabled
- Big health, armor, ammo text on the exhud now correctly follows the `Colored Numbers` setting
- Overlay added by console is now disabled if the automap is up
- A few other fixes and tweaks
