### v1.3.0

**The Colorful Update**
- Added `Solid Color Background` statusbar feature (inspired by Woof - different implementation)
- Added `Colored Borderbox` feature
  - Colors the borders of sides of graphics (ex: TITLEPIC, INTERPIC, HELP, etc) based on the average color of said lump
  - Loosely based off Doom Retro implimentation
  - Also works for Raw-format Heretic / Hexen graphics

**Visual Tweaks**
- OpenGL dark overlay is now improved
  - now only uses the main palette, and ignores other colormaps (example: invulnerabilty, Boom Colormap sectors)
- Extended `Skip IWAD Map Names` logic to Intermission (if no `CWILV**` graphics found, use generic `Level #` text similar to UMAPINFO)
- Added `STDISK` and `STCDROM` support (General > Misc > Data Access Icon)
- Reworked Help / ReadMe screens
  - Now shows PWAD CREDIT if PWAD HELP isn't found (since PrBoom+ had the CREDIT for HELP for many years)
  - Order of precedence: PWAD HELP > PWAD CREDIT > Nyan Doom Credit Screen

**Menu / Config Stuff**
- Complete menu layout overhaul (now much closer to DSDA-Doom)
- Added dependant menu options (some options get disabled under certain conditions)
- Complevel menu option is disabled if `-complevel ##` or `COMPLVL`/`GAMEVERS` lump is read (since changing this setting did nothing already in this context)
- Combined boom and vanilla translucency settings into one setting (`Display > Nyan > Translucent Sprites`)
- Removed `SSG on Arms` option in menu (config option still available)
- Set `Skip IWAD Map Names` to "on" by default

**Cheats**
- Most `TNT-` prefix cheats have been renamed to match Woof/MBF cheats (aka just removed `TNT`).
  - `TNTEM` and `TNTKA` are still present
  - Added new cheat aliases: `KILLEM` and `idk`
- New Cheats: `IDDWT #`, `IDDF **`, and `IDDET`
- Added `IDDWT #` cheat to find placed weapons on the automap
  - Uses weapon number to find weapon (ex: `IDDWT 3` will look for the shotgun)
  - Chainsaw (8) and SSG (9) use Boom weapon numbers
  - Cheat is repeatable (once typing `IDDWT 3`, you can continue hitting `3` to cycle through all map placed shotguns in the map)
  - Supports both Heretic and Hexen
- Added `IDDF **` cheat to find specific keys
  - Based off Nugget Doom
  - Heretic supported. Not Hexen compatible
- Added `IDDET` cheat to find exit lines
  - Based off Nugget Doom
  - Supports both Heretic and Hexen
  - Cheat is repeatable like other `IDD*T` cheats
- `IDNUT` has been "improved"

**Automap**
- Automap is now printed at full screen regardless of lower zoom levels (via -/+).
  - Opaque automap will now print full screen (just like in Vanilla and Woof)
  - Overlay automaps will now print automap/fade over `GRNROCK` border (similar to Woof)
- Automap Title will now cycle between the map title and author if UMAPINFO/MAPINFO author field is present (can be disabled via `map_title` argument or menu option: `Automap > Cycle Level Title / Author`)
- Death exits are now marked on the automap (both normal and secret)
- "Cleared spot 0" no longer shows in favour of "Cleared all marks"
- Hexen / Heretic now have their own customisable automap colours
- Hexen / Heretic can now add automap marks

**Nyan Indicator Tweaks**
- Berserk graphic indicator is now simplified (now just `STFPSTR0-1`) [Removed Unity graphic in favour of lump colour translation]
- Armor / Berserk Indicators now only use the default lumps if found in a PWAD
  - Berserk off/on:       `STFPSTR0`/`STFPSTR1`
  - Armor off/green/blue: `STFARMS0`/`STFARMS1`/`STFARMS2`

**Bug Fixes**
- Vastly improved animate/widescreen lump system (instead of constantly processing lumps, new lumps are now stored in an internal database)
- Fixed multiplayer demo playback crash (example: Alien Vendetta's first Multiplayer Internal Demo)
- Fixed Doom Shareware crash (exhud was looking for the berserk sprite)
- Fixed "previous weapon" not working for the Chainsaw in Vanilla
- Fixed some widescreen patches not displaying correctly (example: widescreen patches for Doom Episode 3 intermission)
- Fixed TNTFAST cheat

**Hexen / Heretic Fixes**
- Fixed Hexen keys on the HUD disappearing when changing maps (only should disappear per hub)
- Fixed Hexen 4th weapon pieces on HUD
- Fixed Heretic Shareware crash (when using warp above episode 1)
- Disabled screenwipe for Heretic
- Hexen / Heretic now have their own customisable automap colours
- Hexen / Heretic can now add automap marks

**Other stuff**
