**Lump Changes**

**Visual Tweaks**
- OpenGL dark overlay is now improved
  - now only uses the main palette, and ignores other colormaps (example: invulnerabilty, Boom Colormap sectors)

- Added `STDISK` and `STCDROM` support (General > Misc > Data Access Icon)

- Complete menu layout overhaul (now much closer to DSDA-Doom)

- New Cheats: `IDDWT #`, `IDDF **`, and `IDDET`
- Added `IDDWT #` cheat to find placed weapons on the automap
  - Uses weapon number to find weapon (ex: `IDDWT 3` will look for the shotgun)
  - Chainsaw (8) and SSG (9) use Boom weapon numbers
  - Cheat is repeatable (once typing `IDDWT 3`, you can continue hitting `3` to cycle through all map placed shotguns in the map)
  - Supports both Heretic and Hexen
- Added `IDDF **` cheat to find specific keys
  - Based off Nugget Doom
  - Heretic supported. Not Hexen compatible
- Added `IDDET` cheat to find exit lines

  - Armor off/green/blue: `STFARMS0`/`STFARMS1`/`STFARMS2`

- Fixed multiplayer demo playback crash (example: Alien Vendetta's first Multiplayer Internal Demo)
- Fixed Doom Shareware crash (exhud was looking for the berserk sprite)
- Fixed "previous weapon" not working for the Chainsaw in Vanilla
